### Contribute

- This project is considered complete from a content perspective but the code quality can drastically be improved. For instance by breaking `App.tsx` file down into more components, TypeScript typings can be used more frequently, etc. More unit tests could be added as well. Long story short it has been implemented quickly as a hackathon. For all these reasons, only [Issues](https://github.com/fbpellas/fbpellas.github.io/issues) about the actual website (e.g. content, bugs, etc.) are welcomed. No issues about the code is welcomed yet. Thank you!
