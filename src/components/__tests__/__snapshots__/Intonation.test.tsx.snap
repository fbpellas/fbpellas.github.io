        The word 
        <i>
          test
        </i>
         is the focus word, which is stressed or emphasized. When a word is stressed, the pitch is higher. There are 2 basic types of intonation: rising and falling.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        In the first sentence, the intonation falls at the end of the sentence to show that the sentence is finished. On the other hand, the intonation on the second statement rises to show surprise or disbelief. The next sections discuss the different patterns of intonation:
